Various days are in separate directories, each with their own main. Typically each module has a part1 and a part2,
though a few times I didn't keep the part1 once I solved it.

## Summary:

Day 1: Simple parsing and totaling.

Day 2: Simulate simple strategy game and determine total score.

Day 3: Analyze elf "ruck sacks" and determine bad priorities.

Day 4: Simulate elf "cleaning sections" and determine overlapping
    assignment pairs.

Day 5: Simulate cargo crane loading procedure and determine the top of the stacks

Day 6: Decode communication stream and find start-of-message markers.

Day 7: Parse a log of shell commands and simulate a file system. Find smallest
    directory that would free up sufficient space to run an update. Required
    recursive search to optimize.

Day 8: From forest map, calculate "visibility distance" and "scenic score".

Day 9: Simulate movement of a rope, where the motion propagates down a rope
    with a number of knots.

Day 10: Simulate "CRT Monitor" and generate image based on input instructions.

Day 11: Calculate monkey "worry level" based on optimizing chasing strategy.

Day 12: Navigate map and determine fewest steps to get to location with best signal.
    Uses Diykstra's Algorithm for optimizing graph path.

Day 13: Decode nested packet format and determine "decoder key". Requires parsing and
    tricky nested data structure.

Day 14: Simulate falling sand and calculate amount of sand under various scenarios.

Day 15: Find beacon coordinate based on overlapping sensor maps. Part 2 required calculating
    overlaps using data structures.

Day 16: Simulate elephants opening valves in a cavern map, and find the optimal strategy.
    Part 2 required tricky dynamic programming to cull the tree size to reasonable numbers.

Day 17: Simulate falling rocks and calculate height of tower. Rocks may be irregularly
    shaped, so required some collision detection. Part 2 simulated 1,000,000,000,000
    rocks dropping, so required figuring out a pattern and extrapolating.

Day 18: Calculate total surface areas of a set of cubes with adjacent faces.

Day 19: Calculate largest number of "geodes" that can be produced by "machine
    blueprints". Required optimizing a graph with a large number of nodes.

Day 20: Decrypt "grove positioning system" using the given algorithm.

Day 21: Interpret "monkey math" operations and generate answer. Part 2 required doing
    a gradient ascent algorithm to find the optimal solution.

Day 22: Simulate a map on the surface of a cube and trace path used by monkeys.
    Required simulating cube faces and following a path across it.

Day 23: Optimization problem of simulating a travel process finding a round where
    "no elf moves".

Day 24: Navigate through a map, avoiding blizzards, and calculate fewest number of
    minutes. Part 2 was much larger scale. Uses a Breadth-First-Search algorithm
    to optimize the path.

Day 25: Convert odd base-5 numbers to and from regular integers, where the base actually
    contains negative numbers. Math problem.
